1.  CI is about the early and frequent merging of code changes
  CD is about automated and reliable release of the code

2. Automation is important in software development because it reduces repetitive manual work, improves consistency, and speeds up delivery.

3. CI/CD pipelines improve teamwork and software quality by creating a culture of collaboration, automation, and rapid feedback, leading to higher-quality software and smoother teamwork.

4. The challenges I faced while setting this up is the spacing of the code on python and rendering the code through actions because of the errors on my code
